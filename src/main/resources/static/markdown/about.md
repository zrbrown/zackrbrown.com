I'm Zack Brown. I live in Kansas City, MO and have lived in the region since 2011. I've been a professional software engineer since that time as well, after graduating from Iowa State University with a BS in Computer Science.

This site is written using Spring Boot and Freemarker with a PostgreSQL database. Both are hosted at DigitalOcean, with the Tomcat server running on Ubuntu in a Docker container.
